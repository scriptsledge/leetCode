## 🚀 Repository Structure

Each problem is neatly organized in its own directory, named after the LeetCode problem number. This structure makes it easy to navigate and find specific solutions.

- **`/problem-number`**: Contains all files related to a specific problem.
  - `readme.md`: A detailed breakdown of the problem, including the description, examples, and my solution approach.
  - `solution.py` or `solution.cpp`: The source code for the solution.
